   *
   * Unfortunately JavaScript (ES5) does not support lookbehind expressions such ?<! and ?<=.
   * I've faked it by replacing the ordinary lookbehind, (?<!.), with the rather
   * convoluted ^((?:(?!.).)*). This means "nothing can come before the key, [A-Z0-9]{20}".
   *
   * It's counterpart, (?!.) means "nothing can come after the key, [A-Z0-9]{20}".
   *
   * For a deep explanation,
   * see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7376238/javascript-regex-look-behind-alternative
